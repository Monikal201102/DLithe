    <p>Eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud explosion near the central power grid at approximately 6 AM. Officials are currently investigating the cause, though preliminary reports suggest a possible technical failure. Meanwhile, businesses, hospitals, and transport systems were heavily impacted, with authorities urging residents to remain patient as repair work continues.</p>

    <p>“It was like the entire city suddenly went dark,” said Sarah Thompson, a local shop owner. “We had to close our store for half the day, and even traffic lights weren’t working.”</p>

    <p>City officials have assured the public that power will be fully restored by evening, and an official report is expected to be released soon.</p>
